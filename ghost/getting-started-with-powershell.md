# Getting Started with PowerShell

Introduction

I haven't been the most enthuasiastic user of command lines in the past. I dabbled here and there but I've mostly used GUIs whenever possible. Most of the time, this didn't have any negative effects on my productivity.

When I started using Azure however, there were a number of tasks that were not easily performed using the old portal. Reading online, I found that the tasks could be run more quickly if I used PowerShell. I then began automating daily tasks where I could but this was only when I had down time from other projects (which could be months) and it always took me some time in order to get my head into the syntax and thought processes related to PowerShell.

I'm writing this to add some personal documentation so that I can cut down on the time spent relearning the language and hopefully write better scripts in the future.
