# Getting Started with PowerShell

## Book Notes

I found that the book "Lear Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches" by Don Jones and Jeffrey Hicks an excellent guide for learning PowerShell

## Introduction

I haven't been the most enthuasiastic user of command lines in the past. I dabbled here and there but I've mostly used GUIs whenever possible. Most of the time, this didn't have any negative effects on my productivity.

When I started using Azure however, there were a number of tasks that were not easily performed using the old portal. Reading online, I found that the tasks could be run more quickly if I used PowerShell. I found out that GUIs are a great way of finding out what a tool is capable of by clicking around and seeing what is available.

Once the process to perform a task is learned there aren't any other performance improvements that can be made when using the GUI. You can then look at automating the task using something like PowerShell which could potentially turn a number of clicks into just one.

Naturally the potential for making my job easier in the long run was very appealing to me. I began automating daily tasks where I could but this was only when I had down time from other projects (which could be months between these opportunities) and it always took me some time in order to get my head into the syntax and thought processes related to PowerShell.

I'm writing this to add some personal documentation so that I can cut down on the time spent relearning the language and hopefully write better scripts in the future.

## Notes

I'm using Windows 10 and PowerShell 5. I'll go through getting the version of PowerShell on the machine further down. Most of the stuff in this series will work in older versions but Microsoft is updating and improving PowerShell all the time, including getting it to work on Mac/Linux so keep an eye out for updates.
